# apprenticeship-2022_08_22-cpp_diary_file_generator

I write a diary digitally and keep it on my PC. Because school told me to come up with a project on my own, I decided to write a program in C++ to make my life a little easier with generating new files for my diary. I intentionally went with a fairly simple project because I had taken a break for two months or so, so I was quite out of my routine.

`clang++_-O3.sh` works exclusively on Linux machines if I'm not mistaken. In order to compile the code yourself, you *will* need to have the `fmt` library installed. Don't ask me how to do that - it seems I've gotten that simply by installing the clang suite through the Arch-Linux repos.
